## 1. Timing Libraries

### What is a PDK?

A **Process Design Kit (PDK)** is a collection of files provided by a semiconductor foundry (like SkyWater) that enables designers to create an Integrated Circuit (IC) for that specific manufacturing process. It includes:

- **Technology files** - Process parameters and design rules
- **Simulation models** - Device models for circuit simulation  
- **Timing Libraries (.lib files)** - Performance characteristics of pre-designed standard cells

### Understanding the Library Name

The name of a timing library file is very descriptive. Let's break down the example for the SKY130 PDK:

**Example:** `sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib`

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `sky130` | SkyWater 130nm manufacturing technology |
| `fd_sc_hd` | Foundry Standard Cell library with High-Density cells |
| `tt` | Process corner: Typical-Typical |
| `025C` | Operating Temperature: 25¬∞ Celsius |
| `1v80` | Operating Voltage: 1.80 Volts |

### PVT Corners Explained

A chip's performance varies based on **Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT)**. To ensure a design will function reliably, it must be tested across a range of these conditions, known as PVT corners.

**Common PVT Corners:**
- **Slow corner** - Worst-case performance (high temperature, low voltage, slow process)
- **Typical corner** - Nominal performance conditions  
- **Fast corner** - Best-case performance (low temperature, high voltage, fast process)

Testing across these corners ensures the design works under all expected operating conditions.

## 2. Hierarchical vs. Flatten Synthesis

When synthesizing a design that contains multiple sub-modules, the synthesis tool can take one of two main approaches: **Hierarchical** or **Flatten**.

### Hierarchical Synthesis

Hierarchical synthesis preserves the modular structure of the design. The tool synthesizes each module in the hierarchy as a distinct entity and then connects them. This is the default behavior in Yosys.

#### Advantages ‚úÖ
- **Faster synthesis** - Each module synthesized independently
- **Lower memory usage** - Smaller problem size per module
- **Easier debugging** - Module boundaries preserved for traceability

#### Disadvantages ‚ùå
- **Less optimal design** - Cannot perform optimizations across module boundaries
- **Potential inefficiencies** - May miss global optimization opportunities

#### Yosys Command Flow (Hierarchical)

```tcl
yosys

read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

read_verilog multiple_modules.v

synth -top multiple_modules

abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_hier_netlist.v
```

Example:

<img width="800" height="450" alt="show_multi_mod" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/112b1b9c-4369-4a74-b5cf-0d03f866c172" />


### Flatten Synthesis

Flatten synthesis is an approach where the tool first collapses the entire design hierarchy, merging all sub-modules into a single, large module.

#### Advantages ‚úÖ
- **Maximum optimization** - Allows optimization across module boundaries
- **Best performance** - Potentially smallest area and fastest timing
- **Global view** - Tool can see entire design for optimization

#### Disadvantages ‚ùå
- **Slower synthesis** - Can be very slow and memory-intensive for large designs
- **Harder debugging** - Original module structure lost
- **Complex ECOs** - Engineering change orders more difficult

#### Yosys Command Flow (Flatten)

The command `flatten` removes hierarchy from your design and converts it into a single module netlist.

```tcl
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

read_verilog multiple_modules.v

flatten

synth -top multiple_modules

abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_flat_netlist.v
```
Example:

<img width="800" height="450" alt="show_multi_mod_flat" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab264664-1a2b-45c0-a8a7-0d038f42fff2" />

## 3. Different Coding Styles for Flip-Flops

Flip-flops are essential for synchronizing digital logic, and set/reset signals are used to force them into a known initial state.

### Asynchronous Reset

An asynchronous reset changes the flop's state **immediately**, independent of the clock.

```verilog
always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_reset)
begin
	if(async_reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else	
		q <= d;
end
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Reset in sensitivity list alongside clock
- Immediate response to reset assertion
- Used when instant reset response is required

### Synchronous Reset

A synchronous reset only affects the flop on the **next active clock edge**.

```verilog
always @ (posedge clk )
begin
	if (sync_reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else	
		q <= d;
end
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Only clock in sensitivity list
- Reset synchronized to clock edge
- Eliminates reset-related metastability issues

### Asynchronous Set

An asynchronous set forces the flop's output to '1' **immediately**, regardless of the clock.

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge async_set)
begin
    if (async_set)
        q <= 1'b1;  // Set takes immediate effect
    else
        q <= d;     // Normal operation
end
```

### Synchronous Set

A synchronous set forces the flop's output to '1' only on the **next active clock edge**.

```verilog
always @ (posedge clk)
begin
	if(sync_set)
		q <= 1'b1;
	else	
		q <= d;
end
```

### Common Yosys Synthesis Commands for Flip-Flops

The following sequence of commands is used to synthesize any of the flip-flop designs, map them to the library cells, and view the result. The `dfflibmap` command maps flip-flops (like DFFs, latches) in your RTL design to the equivalent sequential cells from a given standard cell library (.lib file).
Note: If the D-FF is not present in the existing library then we need to read the library in which D-FF is present.

```tcl
yosys> read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

yosys> read_verilog dff_asyncres.v

yosys> synth -top dff_asyncres

yosys> dfflibmap -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

yosys> abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

yosys> show
```

## 4. Results

### Synthesis Netlists üìú

#### Hierarchical Netlist
The hierarchical netlist preserves the design's modularity. You can clearly see the instances of sub-modules being connected:

#### Flatten Netlist  
The flatten netlist merges all logic into a single module. The original module boundaries are gone, replaced by a "flat" sea of logic gates:

### Waveform Analysis üìâ

#### Asynchronous Reset Behavior
- **Output `q` goes to 0 instantly** when reset becomes active
- Reset effect is independent of clock edge

<img width="800" height="450" alt="waveform_dff_async_res" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b2b2665-da5a-4c86-a1fb-c1e9e26742c1" />


#### Synchronous Reset Behavior  
- **Output `q` waits for the next rising clock edge** after reset becomes active before it goes to 0
- Reset effect synchronized with clock

<img width="800" height="450" alt="waveform_dff_sync_res" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/080a9bf8-6da7-4f7d-8e89-e81d12e8c2ee" />


### Synthesized Flip-Flop Circuits üî¨

#### Asynchronous Reset Synthesis
- The reset signal is connected **directly to the dedicated asynchronous clear (CLR) pin** of the library's D-flip-flop cell
- Hardware reset capability utilized

<img width="800" height="450" alt="show_dff_asyncres" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3072e033-8c19-467d-b2eb-1006528460bd" />


#### Synchronous Reset Synthesis
- The reset signal is fed into **combinational logic (e.g., a multiplexer)** that precedes the D input of the flip-flop
- Reset functionality implemented in combinational logic rather than using dedicated hardware pins

## Key Takeaways

1. **Library Selection**: Choose appropriate timing libraries based on your target PVT corners
2. **Synthesis Strategy**: Use hierarchical for faster compilation and debugging, flatten for maximum optimization
3. **Reset Design**: Choose async reset for immediate response, sync reset for metastability-free operation
4. **Trade-offs**: Every design decision involves trade-offs between area, timing, power, and debuggability

Understanding these concepts is crucial for successful digital design synthesis and achieving optimal results in your ASIC or FPGA implementations.
